            I am announcing an artistic project.<br/>
            The project is unnamed.<br/>
            Eventually, it is likely to be named.<br/>
            It is absolutely certain that naming the project will not adequately define it. For the time being, it will simply be referred to as “the project.”<br/>
            <br/>
            I have already begun the project. I am simply announcing its existence and declaring the next stage.<br/>
            It is multi-layered, multi-faceted and takes place over a continuum of time.<br/>
            More will be shared when appropriate. I am confident that if I am not able to see the project all the way through, others will, or it won't matter.<br/>
            But don’t worry, I do not plan on ending my work on it any time soon.<br/>
            I will continue to complete works from prior periods, even as I work on this next one.<br/>
            <br/>
            We begin this stage with zen circles.<br/>
