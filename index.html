I am announcing an artistic project.
The project is unnamed.
Eventually, it is likely to be named. 
It is absolutely certain that naming the project will not adequately define it. For the time being, it will simply be referred to as “the project.”

I have already begun the project. I am simply announcing its existence and declaring the next stage.
It is multi-layered, multi-faceted and takes place over a continuum of time.
More will be shared when appropriate. I am confident that if I am not able to see the project all the way through, others will. But don’t worry, I do not plan on ending my work on it soon.
I will continue to complete works from prior periods, even as I work on this next one.

We begin this stage with zen circles.
